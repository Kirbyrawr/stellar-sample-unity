Build Challenge
---------------
This project was submitted for Build Challenge of March 2018 of Stellar Foundation, please don't make another submission just copying this integration.

Before Start
---------------
Please take a look at the different licenses.
Be careful as this project is very experimental.

Description
---------------
This repository contains the integration of the Stellar C# SDK made by Elucidsoft into Unity 3D
It contains some scripts for pay from one account to another, i'm planning on expand this to a proper manager that is not a demo one, so please don't use the demo as your base because it's not a proper generic manager.

Risks
---------------
This project is extremely experimental and insecure at the moment, please don't use it in production environment.
I'm not responsible if anything happens to any account be it in public environment or test environment.

Requeriments
---------------
Unity 2018.1.0b4 (Beta)
Setting up the project to work with Net Standard 2.0 (Experimental)

How to test it
---------------
Go to demo scene.
Press Play.
Click any product.
Wait a bit without touch anything (I need to fix this)
You will see a log in the console that is a response.

Please keep in mind that this is still a work in progress since i'm still learning a lot of things about Stellar so if anything doesn't make sense i will probably delete it from the board.


I hope you find this interesting for you and you can expand this integration more, i'm still thinking what to make with this integration but there are a lot of possibilities, just please keep in mind the security of the end user.
